                                <p class="post-description">Here's the promised post on what I am planning to do with this place.</p>
                                <div class="post-top-divider"></div>
                                <img src="../media/images/hecto.jpg" class="post-image"></img>
                                <div class="post-top-divider"></div>
                                <p class="post-text">So I have a blog now. What am I gonna do with it? What is the plan?</p>
                                <p class="post-text">Well, what I plan to do, is to have several topics around. One of them is about the progress I am making with this website. This post belongs exactly to it.</p>
                                <p class="post-text">The other topics are only concepts for now, as I have not came up with a proper post for each one of them and do not even know what to write. But I will try to explain them to you.</p>
                                <p class="post-text">Remember the poll from the page which deceitfully claims to be "About Me"? Well, I really can talk about a poll for quite a while. And you know what? Nobody is gonna stop me from doing that here. I can write a novel about a poll if I want to. You probably won't read it, but you may also not be reading this, so I've got nothing to lose. So I guess you can expect something pretty random soon. It is if I don't kill myself in attempts to write these posts and manually create individual pages for them, of course.</p>
                                <div class="post-top-divider"></div>
                                <img src="../media/images/hectoreading.jpg" class="post-image"></img>
                                <div class="post-top-divider"></div>
                                <p class="post-text">The other topic is much simpler in it's idea. Now that I became a decent book reader, I just want to write about what I've read. Reviews, perhaps. It is a good way to train my writing and language skills, I think. And I don't really see nothing negative coming out of this. So why not give it a try?</p>
                                <p class="post-text">So I think I'm gonna leave it right here. Not because I've got nothing else to say, but because I am tired of writing text inside an editor that is meant for creating html and css files and also programming, not writing. I'm working to fix the pain of pointless copying the same pages over and over again and writing text where it's not meant to be written, but when I will be done, the thing won't be suitable for GitHub Pages anymore and you won't be able to use this site. And then what's even the point? I will need to rent a server for this and, possibly, buy a domain. And I do not have any money for that. But that's not to worry about for now, as I may not have money, I have time to suffer.</p>
                                <p class="post-text">I will be seeing you once more right here next time. Goodbye.</p>
                                <p class="post-text">P.S. Now I need to find pictures for this thing...</p>
                                <p class="post-text">P.P.S Never mind, Hectavius' got me covered.</p>
